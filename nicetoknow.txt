we have the causal with the grounding triangles

and the grounding is now done with a form with transforms and references

with this we can model any problem

but is this a breakthrough? maybe .... yes, maybe ... no

we need something more

like for instance, a world model

or a joystick paradigm where we can rotate and manipulate

the nodes and edges and see the planning for a certain situation

compare it to empa-assist where there is a graph.

and we could perhaps join the two projects: empa-assist and tempflow

a form element consists of three things: before, after and reference
